        <p>
            Once upon a time, a Cal State Long Beach comp sci student came up with a great idea to open a restaurant
            that spiced things up. He came up with the idea of opening a Thai restaurant since he would go to one all
            the time when he was younger and decided to name it H-Thai-ML because the first language he learned was
            HTML. Get it? He decided to open it up in his hometown Glendale, CA. A lot of people got wind of the place
            and business started booming.
